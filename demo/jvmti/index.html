<h1>JVMTI Demonstration Code</h1>

<p>
The 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine Tools Interface (JVMTI)
is a native tool interface provided in v1.5.
Native libraries that use JVMTI and are loaded into the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine
via the -agentlib, -agentpath, or -Xrun (deprecated) interfaces, are
called Agents.
<p>
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jvmti">JVMTI</A>
was designed to work with the
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Native Interface 
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni">JNI</A>),
and eventually displace the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine Debugging Interface 
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jvmdi-spec.html">JVMDI</A>)
and the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine Profiling Interface 
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jvmpi/index.html">JVMPI</A>).

<p>
We have tried to create a set of demonstration agents that should
help demonstrate many of the features and abilities of the
interface. This list of demonstration agents will change over time.
They are provided as educational tools and as starting
points for 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> tool development.


<h2>Agents</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<A HREF="versionCheck">versionCheck</A>
<br>
This is a extremely small agent that does nothing but check the
version string supplied in the jvmti.h file, with the version
number supplied by the VM at runtime.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="mtrace">mtrace</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that does method tracing.
It uses Bytecode Instrumentation (BCI) via the java_crw_demo library.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="gctest">gctest</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that does garbage collection counting.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="heapViewer">heapViewer</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that does some basic heap inspections.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="heapTracker">heapTracker</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that does BCI to capture object creation
and track them.
It uses Bytecode Instrumentation (BCI) via the java_crw_demo library.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="waiters">waiters</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that gets information about threads
waiting on monitors.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="hprof">hprof</A>
<br>
This is a large agent that does heap and cpu profiling.
This demo agent is actually built into the 

Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Runtime Environment (JRE).
It uses Bytecode Instrumentation (BCI) via the java_crw_demo library.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> hprof is NOT a small or simple agent, the other smaller demos
should be looked at first.
</li>

</ul>



<h2>Agent Support</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<A HREF="java_crw_demo">java_crw_demo</A>
<br>
This is a demo C library that does class file to class file
transformations or BCI (Bytecode Instrumentation).
It is used by several of the above agents.
</li>


</ul>



<h2>Native Library Build Hints</h2>

<p>
All libraries loaded into java are assumed to be MT-safe (Multi-thread safe).
This means that multiple threads could be executing the code at the same
time, and static or global data may need to be placed in critical
sections. See the Raw Monitor interfaces for more information.

<p>
All native libraries loaded into the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine,
including Agent libraries,
need to be compiled and built in a compatible way.
Certain native compilation options or optimizations should be avoided,
and some are required.
More information on this options is available in the man pages for
the various compilers.

<ul>




<li>
On Solaris and using the Sun C/C++ Compilers 5.5 (Studio 8 Compiler Collection):
<ul>

<li>
Required: On SPARC, -xarch=v8 or -xarch=v9
<br>
This is to be specific as to the sparc architecture.
Be careful when using -xarch and some of the other compiler optimization
options that target specific processors, you can easily limit the types 
of machines the library will run on,
e.g. using -xarch=v9b will limit you to UltraSPARC III capable processor.
</li>

<li>
Required: -mt
<br>
This should be used for compiles and links, it makes sure the library is
built properly to be a MT-safe library.
</li>

<li>
Required: On SPARC, -xregs=no%appl.
<br>
Certain registers should not be used by system libraries.
</li>

<li>
Recommended: No higher than -xO2 on optimization.
<br>
It is important that these libraries have frame pointer register usage.
Optimizations above -xO2 can remove the use of frame pointer registers
and cause problems when doing stack frame walking.
</li>

<li>
Recommended: ldd -r <i>LibraryName</i>
<br>
After the shared library has been built, the utility
'ldd' (or 'ldd -r') can be used to verify that all dependent libraries 
have been satisfied, and all externs can be found.
If 'ldd' says anything is missing, it is very likely that the JVM will
be unable to load this library.
</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li>
On Linux (Using the gcc version 3.2):
<ul>

<li>
Required: -fno-omit-frame-pointer
<br>
It is important that these libraries have frame pointer register usage.
</li>

<li>
Recommended: -fno-strict-aliasing
<br>
Avoid this pointer optimization.
</li>

<li>
Required: -Wl,-soname=<i>LibraryName</i>
<br>
When building the shared library (-shared option), 
this option makes sure the library name is stored inside the library.
</li>

<li>
Required: -static-libgcc
<br>
When building the shared library (-shared option), this option
allows for maximum portability of the library between different
flavors of Linux. 
</li>

<li>
Recommended: ldd -r <i>LibraryName</i>
<br>
Provides the same checking as Solaris (see above).
</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li>
On Windows and using the Microsoft C++ Compiler:
<ul>

<li>
Recommended: -Op.
<br>
Avoid optimizations that change floating point precision.
</li>

<li>
Required: -Gy.
<br>
Allow for function level linking.
</li>

<li>
Recommended: VC++ dumpbin/exports and VC++ "Dependency Walker"
<br>
Provides dependency information similar to ldd.
</li>


</ul>
</li>




</ul>
